# Analysis_of_Fuel_Economy_Data

Files include Python Notebook with completed code and supporting CSV files

### Project Objectives and Overview

* Explore Fuel Economy data of 2008 and 2018.
* Perform data wrangling to unify the format of data from the two datasets.
* Compute descriptive statistics in Python, pandas and numPy to answer the questions posed about the data

### Questions answered:

* Are more unique models using alternative sources of fuel? By how much?
* How much have vehicle classes improved in fuel economy?
* What are the characteristics of SmartWay vehicles? Have they changed over time?
* What features are associated with better fuel economy?
* For all of the models that were produced in 2008 that are still being produced in 2018, how much has the mpg improved and which vehicle improved the most?
